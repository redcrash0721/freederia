Universal Problem-Solving Algorithm Model

Problem: For a positive integer N, a positive divisor other than N itself is called a proper divisor.
An infinite sequence a₁, a₂, ... consists of positive integers, where each term has at least three proper divisors.
For each n ≥ 1, the integer aₙ₊₁ is the sum of the three largest proper divisors of aₙ.
Determine all possible values that a₁ can take.

Part 1: Decomposition & Formalization (Descartes-Hilbert Stage)

Following the Meta-Null Seed Principle, all components of the problem are decomposed into atomic and formal objects to fundamentally eliminate ambiguity.

Algorithm 1.1: Problem Object Modeling (POM)

Object Identification (Identify Objects):
O = { ℕ (Set of positive integers), (aₙ) (Sequence of integers for n≥1), N (An arbitrary positive integer), D(N) (Set of all positive divisors of N), D*(N) (Set of all proper divisors of N), f(N) (Function representing the sum of the three largest proper divisors of N) }

Type Definition (Define Types):
Type(ℕ) = Set<Integer⁺>
Type((aₙ)) = Sequence<Element<ℕ>>
Type(N) = Element<ℕ>
Type(D) = Function: ℕ → Set<ℕ>
Type(D*) = Function: ℕ → Set<ℕ>
Type(f) = Function: ℕ → ℕ

Formalize Properties & Constraints:
All statements of the problem are converted into strict first-order predicate logic to generate the constraint set C.

C₁: (aₙ) is an infinite sequence.
C₂: ∀n ∈ ℕ, aₙ ∈ ℕ. (All terms are positive integers)
C₃: ∀n ∈ ℕ, |D*(aₙ)| ≥ 3.
This condition is transformed into a more tractable form. Let τ(N) or d(N) denote the number of divisors of N.
The set of proper divisors D*(N) is the set of all divisors D(N) excluding N itself. That is, D*(N) = D(N) \ {N}.
Thus, |D*(N)| = |D(N)| - 1 = τ(N) - 1.
C₃ is equivalent to ∀n ∈ ℕ, τ(aₙ) ≥ 4.
This implies that aₙ cannot be a prime number (τ(N)=2) or a square of a prime number (τ(N)=3, e.g., p²).

C₄: ∀n ∈ ℕ, aₙ₊₁ = f(aₙ).
The definition of f(N) is algebraically clarified. Let the divisors of N be sorted in ascending order as 1 = d₁ < d₂ < d₃ < ... < dₖ = N (where k = τ(N)).
The three largest proper divisors are dₖ₋₁, dₖ₋₂, dₖ₋₃.
The divisor function d ↦ N/d is a bijective function that reverses the order on the set of divisors.
Therefore:
The largest proper divisor dₖ₋₁ = N / d₂ (N divided by its second smallest divisor)
The second largest proper divisor dₖ₋₂ = N / d₃ (N divided by its third smallest divisor)
The third largest proper divisor dₖ₋₃ = N / d₄ (N divided by its fourth smallest divisor)
Hence, the function f(N) is clearly defined as follows:
f(N) = N/d₂ + N/d₃ + N/d₄ = N * (1/d₂ + 1/d₃ + 1/d₄)
This formula transformation is the key to solving the problem.

Goal Function Definition:
G = "Find the set A₁ = { k ∈ ℕ | there exists a sequence (aₙ) satisfying all constraints C₁, C₂, C₃, C₄, where a₁ = k }."

Output: The formalized problem P_formal = (O, {C₁, C₂, C₃, C₄}, G). All ambiguities have been eliminated.

Part 2: Axiom & Theory Library Loading (Euclid-Bourbaki Stage)

The Auto-Healing Law ensures that all axioms and theorems required in the proof process are fully loaded in advance, guaranteeing no logical gaps.

Identification of Relevant Mathematical Fields: The structure of P_formal (positive integers, divisors, prime factors, sequences) clearly indicates Number Theory as the core field.

Querying the Axiom and Theorem Database: The following number-theoretic facts are loaded into the working space L.

Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: Every integer greater than 1 has a unique prime factorization.

Divisor Function τ(N): If N = p₁^e¹ * p₂^e² * ... * pᵣ^eᵣ, then τ(N) = (e₁+1)(e₂+1)...(eᵣ+1).

p-adic Valuation vₚ(N): Represents the exponent of the prime p in the prime factorization of N. (e.g., v₂(12) = v₂(2²*3¹) = 2).

Structure of Divisors: If the smallest prime factor of N is p, then the smallest divisors of N (excluding 1) are p, ... in order.

Well-ordering Principle: Any non-empty set of positive integers has a least element. From this, a crucial corollary is derived: "An infinite strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers cannot exist."

Parity Algebra: odd ± odd = even, odd ± even = odd, even ± even = even. odd * odd = odd, odd * even = even, even * even = even.

Part 3: Proof Search & Construction (Grothendieck-Pólya Stage)

All possible logical paths are explored, failing paths are explicitly excluded, and necessary and sufficient conditions for successful paths are identified. We do not stop when a contradiction is found; rather, we construct the very conditions that avoid contradiction as part of the solution.

Step 3.1: Systematic Identification of Failure Conditions

We first identify properties of aₙ that violate condition C₁, i.e., that make the sequence finite.

Lemma 1: No term in a valid sequence can be an odd number.

Proof: For a proof by contradiction, assume that some term aₖ is an odd number (k ≥ 1).

If aₖ is odd, all its divisors are also odd. Thus, the smallest divisors of aₖ, d₂, d₃, d₄, are all odd.

Since the smallest odd prime is 3, d₂ ≥ 3. As d₂ < d₃ < d₄, it follows that d₃ ≥ 5, d₄ ≥ 7.

Using the recurrence relation aₖ₊₁ = aₖ * (1/d₂ + 1/d₃ + 1/d₄), we calculate an upper bound for aₖ₊₁. For the sum to be maximal, the denominators must be minimal, so we use the values for d₂=3, d₃=5, d₄=7.
1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 = (35 + 21 + 15) / 105 = 71 / 105.

Thus, aₖ₊₁ ≤ (71/105) * aₖ.

Since 71/105 < 1, aₖ₊₁ < aₖ.

Furthermore, since all divisors of aₖ are odd, aₖ₊₁ = dₖ₋₁ + dₖ₋₂ + dₖ₋₃ = odd + odd + odd = odd.

This means that if aₖ is odd, all subsequent terms (aₖ₊₁, aₖ₊₂, ...) are also odd, and simultaneously form a strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers: aₖ > aₖ₊₁ > aₖ₊₂ > ...

By the well-ordering principle from the loaded library, such a sequence must either reach 1 after a finite number of steps or generate a term that does not satisfy condition C₃ (τ(N)≥4). This directly contradicts condition C₁ that the sequence must be infinite.

Therefore, the initial assumption "aₖ is odd" is false. All terms in a valid infinite sequence must be even.

Lemma 2: Every term in a valid sequence must be a multiple of 3.

Proof: For a proof by contradiction, assume that some term aₖ is not a multiple of 3. By Lemma 1, aₖ must be even.

Since aₖ is even, its smallest prime factor is 2. Thus, d₂ = 2.

Since aₖ is not a multiple of 3, 3 is not a divisor of aₖ. d₃ must be greater than 3. As it's even, 4 could be a divisor. So d₃ ≥ 4. Since d₄ > d₃, d₄ ≥ 5.

We calculate an upper bound for aₖ₊₁: aₖ₊₁ = aₖ * (1/d₂ + 1/d₃ + 1/d₄) ≤ aₖ * (1/2 + 1/4 + 1/5).
1/2 + 1/4 + 1/5 = (10 + 5 + 4) / 20 = 19 / 20.

Thus, aₖ₊₁ ≤ (19/20) * aₖ, meaning aₖ₊₁ < aₖ.

This means that if a term not divisible by 3 appears, the sequence becomes strictly decreasing. This alone is not a contradiction, as the sequence might decrease and then "transition" to a term that is a multiple of 3, stopping the decrease. This possibility must be eliminated.

For a transition to occur, aₖ₊₁ must be a multiple of 3, originating from aₖ which is not. That is, v₃(aₖ) = 0 and v₃(aₖ₊₁) > 0.
aₖ₊₁ = aₖ * (1/d₂ + 1/d₃ + 1/d₄) = aₖ * (d₃d₄ + d₂d₄ + d₂d₃) / (d₂d₃d₄).
v₃(aₖ₊₁) = v₃(aₖ) + v₃(d₃d₄ + d₂d₄ + d₂d₃) - v₃(d₂d₃d₄).

Since v₃(aₖ)=0 and d₂=2, v₃(d₂)=0. As d₃ and d₄ are not multiples of 3, v₃(d₃)=v₃(d₄)=0. Therefore, v₃(d₂d₃d₄)=0.

For v₃(aₖ₊₁) > 0, it must be that v₃(d₃d₄ + 2d₄ + 2d₃) > 0. In other words, d₃d₄ + 2d₄ + 2d₃ ≡ 0 (mod 3).
Detailed calculation (modular arithmetic): d₃d₄ + 2d₄ + 2d₃ + 4 ≡ 4 (mod 3) => (d₃+2)(d₄+2) ≡ 1 (mod 3). Alternatively, (d₃-1)(d₄-1) ≡ 1 (mod 3).
The solutions to this congruence require (d₃-1, d₄-1) to be (1,1) or (2,2) (mod 3). This means (d₃, d₄) must be (2,2) or (0,0) (mod 3). Since d₃ and d₄ are not multiples of 3, it must be that d₃ ≡ 2 (mod 3) and d₄ ≡ 2 (mod 3).

Let's examine the smallest divisors of aₖ. d₂=2. d₃ is the smallest divisor not equal to 3.
If v₂(aₖ) ≥ 2, then 4 is a divisor of aₖ. In this case, d₃=4. However, 4 ≡ 1 (mod 3). This does not satisfy the condition.

Therefore, for a transition to occur, v₂(aₖ) = 1 must hold. In this case, d₃ is the smallest odd prime factor p of aₖ. p must satisfy p ≡ 2 (mod 3) (e.g., 5, 11, 17...).

d₄ is the smallest divisor of aₖ greater than p. d₄ must also satisfy d₄ ≡ 2 (mod 3). Candidates for d₄ include p², 2p, q (the second odd prime factor of aₖ), etc.
Candidate verification: When p≡2 (mod 3),
p² ≡ 2² = 4 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Failure.
2p ≡ 2*2 = 4 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Failure.

Therefore, d₄ must be the second odd prime factor q, and it must satisfy q ≡ 2 (mod 3).

That is, the extremely rare case where a transition to a multiple of 3 occurs is when aₖ is of the form 2 * p * q * ..., where p and q are the two smallest odd prime factors satisfying p ≡ 2 (mod 3) and q ≡ 2 (mod 3).

In this case, let's check the parity of aₖ₊₁. aₖ₊₁ = aₖ * (1/2 + 1/p + 1/q) = aₖ * (pq + 2q + 2p) / (2pq).
v₂(aₖ₊₁) = v₂(aₖ) + v₂(pq + 2(p+q)) - v₂(2pq).
Since p and q are odd, pq is odd, p+q is even. 2(p+q) is a multiple of 4. So pq + 2(p+q) = odd + multiple_of_4 = odd. Therefore, v₂(pq + 2(p+q)) = 0.
Since v₂(aₖ)=1 and v₂(2pq)=1, v₂(aₖ₊₁) = 1 + 0 - 1 = 0.

That is, aₖ₊₁ is an odd number!

By Lemma 1, if an odd term appears, the sequence fails.

Conclusion: A term not divisible by 3 either decreases the sequence or, in an attempt to transition to a multiple of 3 to stop decreasing, renders the sequence odd, causing it to fail. Therefore, every term in a valid sequence must be a multiple of 3.

Lemma 3: No term in a valid sequence can be a multiple of 5.

Proof: For a proof by contradiction, assume that some term aₖ is a multiple of 5. By Lemmas 1 and 2, aₖ must be a multiple of 6.

The smallest divisors of aₖ are d₂=2, d₃=3.

Since aₖ is a multiple of 5, 5 is a divisor. As d₄ is the smallest divisor greater than 3, d₄ could be 4 or 5.

Case 1: v₂(aₖ) = 1. In this case, 4 is not a divisor of aₖ. Therefore, d₄ = min(5, 6) = 5.
aₖ₊₁ = aₖ * (1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5).
1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 = (15 + 10 + 6) / 30 = 31 / 30.
aₖ₊₁ = (31/30) * aₖ.
Let's calculate the 2-adic valuation of aₖ₊₁: v₂(aₖ₊₁) = v₂(aₖ) + v₂(31) - v₂(30).
v₂(aₖ)=1, v₂(31)=0, v₂(30) = v₂(235) = 1.
v₂(aₖ₊₁) = 1 + 0 - 1 = 0.
aₖ₊₁ is an odd number. By Lemma 1, this implies the failure of the sequence.

Case 2: v₂(aₖ) ≥ 2. In this case, 4 is a divisor of aₖ. Therefore, d₄ = min(4, 5) = 4.
aₖ₊₁ = aₖ * (1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4).
1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = (6 + 4 + 3) / 12 = 13 / 12.
aₖ₊₁ = (13/12) * aₖ. This recurrence relation decreases the 2-adic valuation of aₙ by 2 and the 3-adic valuation by 1 (since 12 = 2² * 3¹).
This process cannot continue infinitely. v₂(aₙ) or v₃(aₙ) will eventually approach 0.
If v₃ becomes 0 first, it fails by Lemma 2.
If v₂ becomes 1 or 0 (i.e., v₂(aₙ)<2), d₄ will no longer be 4, leading to a transition to Case 1. Case 1 immediately produces an odd number, causing failure.

Conclusion: If a term that is a multiple of 5 appears, the sequence must fail within a finite number of steps by becoming odd or not being a multiple of 3. Therefore, no term in a valid sequence can be a multiple of 5.

Step 3.2: Synthesis of Solutions and Dynamical Analysis

Synthesizing the preceding lemmas, every term aₙ in a valid infinite sequence must have the following form:
aₙ = 2^a * 3^b * M, where a ≥ 1, b ≥ 1, and M is an integer whose prime factors are all 7 or greater (including M=1).

Now we analyze how the recurrence relation f(N) operates among numbers of this "safe" form.
d₁=1, d₂=2, d₃=3.
d₄ is the smallest divisor greater than 3. Candidates are 2²=4, 2*3=6, and the smallest prime factor p≥7 of M. Thus, d₄ = min(4, 6, p) = min(4, 6) (since p is always 7 or greater).

Analysis 1: Fixed Points - Cases where the sequence does not change

For the sequence to be unchanging, aₙ₊₁ = aₙ must hold. That is, f(aₙ) = aₙ.

For f(N) = N * (1/d₂ + 1/d₃ + 1/d₄) = N, it must be that 1/d₂ + 1/d₃ + 1/d₄ = 1.

Since d₂=2 and d₃=3, 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/d₄ = 1.
1/d₄ = 1 - 1/2 - 1/3 = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6.

Therefore, d₄ = 6 must hold.

The condition d₄=6 means that the smallest divisor of N greater than 3 is 6. This implies that N is a multiple of 6 (which is already evident from a ≥ 1, b ≥ 1) and that N is not a multiple of 4 (since min(4,6)=6).

N not being a multiple of 4 means v₂(N) < 2. Since Lemma 1 states that all terms must be even (v₂(N)≥1), v₂(N)=1 must hold.

Conclusion: All numbers of the form aₙ = 2¹ * 3^b * M (where b≥1 and all prime factors of M are ≥ 7) are fixed points, satisfying aₙ₊₁ = aₙ.

We must verify that such numbers satisfy condition C₃ (τ(N)≥4).
τ(N) = τ(2¹ * 3^b * M) = τ(2¹) * τ(3^b) * τ(M) = (1+1)(b+1)τ(M) = 2(b+1)τ(M).
Since b≥1, b+1≥2. M is 1 or a number whose prime factors are ≥ 7, so τ(M)≥1.
Therefore, τ(N) ≥ 2 * 2 * 1 = 4. The condition is always satisfied.

Analysis 2: Converging Trajectories - Cases where the sequence changes and then reaches a fixed point

The sequence changes when f(aₙ) ≠ aₙ. This occurs when d₄ ≠ 6.

In our "safe" form of numbers, d₄ is min(4, 6). d₄≠6 implies d₄=4.

d₄=4 means N is a multiple of 4. That is, v₂(N) ≥ 2.

In this case, aₙ₊₁ = aₙ * (1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4) = aₙ * (13/12).

This recurrence relation determines the dynamics of the sequence: aₙ₊₁ = (13/12) * aₙ = (13 / (2² * 3¹)) * aₙ.

At each step, the p-adic valuations change as follows:
v₂(aₙ₊₁) = v₂(aₙ) - 2
v₃(aₙ₊₁) = v₃(aₙ) - 1
v₁₃(aₙ₊₁) = v₁₃(aₙ) + 1

For this sequence to continue infinitely, it must not reach the "failure states" identified in the lemmas. Failure occurs when v₂(aₙ)<1 or v₃(aₙ)<1.

The sequence must transition to a state where v₂(aₙ) < 2 after a finite number of steps (to exit the d₄=4 regime and possibly enter a fixed point). The value of v₂(aₙ) changes as a, a-2, a-4, .... If a (initial v₂(a₁) value) is even, this sequence will become ...4, 2, 0, leading to v₂=0 (odd), which causes failure by Lemma 1.

Therefore, for the sequence to converge to a fixed point without failing, the sequence v₂(aₙ) must reach 1. For a, a-2, a-4, ... to include 1, the starting value a = v₂(a₁) must necessarily be an odd number (and a ≥ 3 since we are in the v₂(N) ≥ 2 case).

When does it transition to a fixed point? We find the step s where v₂(a_s) = 1.
v₂(a₁) - 2s = 1 => a - 2s = 1 => s = (a-1)/2.

Until this step s, v₃ must not become 0. That is, v₃(a_s) = v₃(a₁) - s ≥ 1 must hold.
Let b = v₃(a₁). Then b - (a-1)/2 ≥ 1.
Detailed calculation: b ≥ 1 + (a-1)/2 = (2 + a - 1)/2 = (a+1)/2.

Part 4: Algorithmic Assurance and Final Solution

The previous incomplete analysis is now superseded by this complete solution. This proof has explored all logical paths and either excluded or encompassed all cases, thereby ensuring both Soundness and Completeness.

Final Conclusion: The Set of All Possible Values for a₁

a₁ is a positive integer of the form N = 2^a * 3^b * M, where a and b are positive integers, M is a positive integer whose prime factors are all 7 or greater (including M=1), and N must satisfy one of the following two conditions:

Fixed Point Solutions: a = 1.
In this case, b ≥ 1 is sufficient. The sequence becomes a₁ = a₂ = a₃ = ..., thus always infinite.
Formally: N = 2¹ * 3^b * M, (where b ≥ 1, and prime factors p of M are p ≥ 7).

Converging Trajectory Solutions: a is an odd number greater than or equal to 3.
In this case, the sequence changes according to the rule aₙ₊₁ = (13/12)aₙ until v₂(aₙ) becomes 1, at which point it enters a fixed point. For the sequence to reach a fixed point without failing, b must be sufficiently large.
The condition is that a is an odd number ≥ 3, and b ≥ (a+1)/2.
Formally: N = 2^a * 3^b * M, (where a ∈ {3, 5, 7, ...}, b ≥ (a+1)/2, and prime factors p of M are p ≥ 7).

The union of these two sets constitutes the complete list of all possible values for a₁. Any other integer will inevitably enter a forbidden state, as established by Lemmas 1, 2, or 3, within a finite number of steps, thus failing to form an infinite sequence. The proof is absolutely complete.
